    <p>No partner, this ain’t a mirage you’re seeing.

        Western Wear is hot right now, and to be perfectly honest, this time around it might be here for good. Not that we’re complaining. Who doesn’t love the idea of feeling like a cowboy from the golden age of Hollywood, even if the only cattle you’ll be herding today is a pack of ground beef from the supermarket?
        
        The point is, contrary to the beliefs of a few odd purists, you don’t need to actually be a cowboy to have fun dressing like one. Western style, also known as western wear, has a deep, rich history that’s uniquely American and reminiscent of rugged frontier life.
        
        Like any style, it’s evolved plenty over time, and modern, contemporary western wear is somewhat removed from its origins. But the DNA is still there, and historical context is what gives clothing its meaning, after all.
        
        Also, it’s nearly summer, which for some reason, tends to be a big season for western wear. But it’s appropriate all year round if you know what you’re doing! That’s why we’ve created this comprehensive guide, so you can dip your pointy boots into the exciting frontier of great western style. Saddle up!

    <h3>From the Ground Up: Western Boots</h3>
    <img src="img/bootimg.jpg" alt="" class="artImg">
    <p>Arguably the most iconic and pervasive emblem of classic western style, western boots are a fitting place to start off this guide.

        First, a small distinction. While the terms “western boot” and “cowboy boot” are often used interchangeably, technically, cowboy boots are a specific type of western boot. But they’re also often what people think of when they picture western style.</p>
        <p>Classic cowboy boots are tall, usually reaching up to the mid-calf, and sometimes even taller. They can have a rounded, squared, or pointed toe, as well as decorative embellishments along the leather. Pull-up tabs or straps and distinctive, tall heels are also considered defining features.

            The best cowboy boots are made from high-quality leather, with properly welted soles that can easily be replaced to make them last for years. In terms of versatility, shades of brown and black tend to be the most easy to style.
            
            Western boots are also remarkably easy to style without committing to the full cowboy look. Whether you live in Houston, Texas, the heart of NYC, or anywhere in between, cowboy boots are an enduring style statement that anyone can wear – with just about anything. Check out our</p>
